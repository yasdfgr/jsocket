# jsocket
Automatically exported from http://code.google.com/p/jsocket

The easy socket solution for javascript.
This library can be used to establish a socket connection from within the browser.

Note
This project is still in a (functional) pre-release state, I would recommend you wait for release 1.0 before using this library in any commercial products. Feel free to play around with it though.
